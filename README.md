Canvas Demos
============
The purpose of this project is to create the same application using different
Canvas frameworks. Impelementation exists for the following frameworks:
* KineticJS

The application uses the following features:
* Images & Sprites
* Animation

The application does not USE any of:
* Drag-n-drop
* Collision detection
* Mouse & Keyboard events

Kinetic JS
==========
* Tutorials - a handful of basic tutorials exist. However, I find Google & StackOverflow
  to be a lot more useful.
* Documentation - documentation for the API exists. However, the documentation is missing
  basic examples.
* User base & StackOverflow - it seems that there is a large user base and a lot of questions
  are covered and answered in StackOverflow.

Nice Features
-------------
* The "Tween" API is very nice and easy to use, and includes a number of Easings.

Shortcomings
------------
* It would be useful to have a generic image loader, even though it is easy to copy the
  image loader from the examples/tutorials.
* The Sprite animation API is somewhat limited and does not have options not to loop
  animations; there are also no events when the animation ends, so making transitions is
  not trivial.
